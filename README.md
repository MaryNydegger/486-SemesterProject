# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
* This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a movie review dataset. The objective is to predict sentiment (positive or negative) based on textual content using machine learning techniques.

### Goals
* * Problem Statement: * Predict sentiment polarity in moview reviews.
* * Dataset: * Utilizing a dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews - 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing.
* * Methodology: * Using text preprocessing, feature engineering, and other machine learning models for analysis.

### Project Structure
* Data: The dataset consists of labeled moview reviews.
* Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction from textual data.
* Model Building: Training and evaluating machone learning models for sentiment classification.
* Evaluation: Assessing model perforamnce using accuracy and other relevant metrics.
