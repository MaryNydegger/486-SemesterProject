# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

### Overview
* This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a movie review dataset. The objective is to predict sentiment (positive or negative) based on textual content using machine learning techniques.

### Goals
* *Problem Statement*: Predict sentiment polarity in moview reviews.
* *Dataset*: Utilizing a dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews - 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing.
* *Methodology*: Using text preprocessing, feature engineering, and other machine learning models for analysis.

### Project Structure
* *Data*: The dataset consists of labeled moview reviews.
* *Preprocessing*: Cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction from textual data.
* *Model Building*: Training and evaluating machone learning models for sentiment classification.
* *Evaluation*: Assessing model perforamnce using accuracy and other relevant metrics.

* The *workflow* follos this process: data loading and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection and training, evaluation and results, and then fine tune things for better performance.  


## Results 
* *Naive Bayes*: Validation Accuracy - 85%, Test Accuracy - 84%
* *Logistic Regression*: Validation Accuracy - XX%, Test Accuracy - XX%
* *SVM*: Validation Accuracy - XX%, Test Accuracy - XX%

### Conclusion 
* *Insights*:
* *Areas for further improvement and refinement*:
